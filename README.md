# The NoTrack project
The No-Track project is a set of tools that can be used :
- For free
- Without any ads
- Without any tracking
  
The only limitation is a rate limit to avoid spam.

I hope you will use it with respect of the work being done.

## What is the Shortener ?
It's a very simple tool that converts the long URL into a short one, with an id instead of the loooooooooong path, it looks better in documents and presentations.

You can find the tool online here : https://s.notrack.cloud/

## What is tracked ?
Short answer is nothing. The long answer is, of course there are some technical logs on the servers, but without any user informations.
Also, the number of use of each link is stored in database.

Nothing else :)

If you want to be sure of that, you can check by yourself on this repository.

## Free to use, but not to run
Of course, these tools are not free to run. I make these because I really like the old web, with no ad, no track and simple content.

## Bugs ? Support ?
This project is made on personal time, with the use of beta version of SvelteKit. there can be bugs, I can take time to fix them.
